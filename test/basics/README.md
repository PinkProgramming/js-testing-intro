# Tutorial 1 - Basic tests

## Exercises

### Test 1. Numerical comparisons

**Step 1**. Structure of tests and syntax for test in JS

Create the file for the tests

- JS: Make sure to include ".test.js" in the end of the filename
- Java: Make sure to include "Test" in the end of the filename

Create a named test with a function (JS) method (Java)

**Step 2**. introduce "matchers" or "assertions"

- JS: For a list of common matchers, refer to [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers)
- Java: For a list of assertions, refer to [JUnit Examples](https://howtodoinjava.com/junit5/junit-5-assertions-examples/)

**Step 3**. Create a test to verify if a vehicle is affordable.

### Test 2. String comparisons

- Create a test to verify if a sentence ends with a period.

Declare a list of String with Swedish greetings.

Create some tests to verify:

- If the list contains common Swedish greetings
- If the list does not contain English greeting
